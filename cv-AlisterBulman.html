    ><p
    >I'm an experienced <strong
      >ZCE qualified PHP DEVELOPER</strong
      > with more than <strong
      >12 years experience</strong
      >, developing database backed website applications and for SME and blue-chip clients using the <strong
      >LAMP</strong
      > (Linux / Apache / MySQL / PHP) platform for back-end web applications and dynamic websites.</p
    ><p
    >I'm a PHP developer, that loves to keep up with technology and write some really elegant software code to help my sites handle large scale and many users. In the last 5 years, I've tended to work on single long-term projects for sites that are the entire business of a company, such as my most recent position, http://peerindex.com.</p
    ><p
    >Since 2007, Iâ€™ve had a particular interest in <strong
      >scaling php websites</strong
      > up to ever larger numbers of people online (or an increasing amount of data being collected from external sources, such as Twitter's API). This requires a multi-disciplinary approach in <strong
      >website architecture</strong
      >, databases and the servers/software to be able to handle hundreds (or thousands) of simultaneous users while still performing all the relevant tasks that a busy website needs to happen in the background.</p
